    * That’s why we decided to write [a sequel to “Cracking the Coding Interview](https://substack.com/redirect/de2f0bdb-90a8-4df3-9743-5a1026695021?j=eyJ1IjoiMmNrNnRkIn0.Z0gA3uR9jdsrb2pRDJnL0xapsi-dH-S84w5wYD6yM8E).” Our goal with this new book is to teach the “why” rather than the “what”, and to go deep into problem-solving approaches.

    * MIKE is a structured, reliable approach for navigating moments of uncertainty. Success doesn’t come from avoiding confusion, it comes from knowing exactly what to do when it hits.
    * ### The four components of MIKE
      * The MIKE framework consists of four main, problem-solving strategies that experienced engineers employ to solve problems when they get stuck:
        * **[M]inimally sketch the naive solution**: Start by establishing a baseline approach, even if it’s inefficient. This ensures you understand the problem, and it gives you something to optimize.
        * **[I]dentify upper and lower bounds**: Use [big O analysis](https://substack.com/redirect/d88b3a86-6987-4965-b996-02ca61281bfe?j=eyJ1IjoiMmNrNnRkIn0.Z0gA3uR9jdsrb2pRDJnL0xapsi-dH-S84w5wYD6yM8E) to narrow down the range of possible solutions. This helps you quickly discard approaches that are too slow or unrealistically fast. See a helpful [visual introduction to Big O analysis.](https://substack.com/redirect/56b3bff8-ca3f-4664-b839-52d8365e1a81?j=eyJ1IjoiMmNrNnRkIn0.Z0gA3uR9jdsrb2pRDJnL0xapsi-dH-S84w5wYD6yM8E)
        * **[K]eywords/triggers**: Look for hints in the problem statement that suggest specific techniques. For example, a sorted input array might trigger thoughts of binary search, while questions involving parentheses often suggest use of a stack.
        * **[E]mploy boosters**: If the first three parts don’t get you unstuck, there’s a series of techniques designed to give you a “boost”. These include optimizing the brute force solution, hunting for useful properties, and ways to decrease difficulty.
