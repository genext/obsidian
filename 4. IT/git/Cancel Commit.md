# Git: How to Cancel Commits

## Essential Concepts

Before learning how to cancel commits, you need to understand these fundamental Git concepts:

- [[HEAD]] - Understanding the HEAD pointer
- [[Commit Hash]] - What commit hashes are and how to use them
- [[Range]] - How to specify ranges of commits with `..`

## Canceling Commits: Different Scenarios
The approach you take depends on whether you've pushed your commits to a remote repository:
- [[Not pushed Commit]] - When commits are only in your local repository
- [[Already Pushed Commit]] - When commits have been pushed to remote (shared with others)
