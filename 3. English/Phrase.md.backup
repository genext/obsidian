무생물 주어(inanimate subjects)
?
A helpful pattern: if you can ask **"What is making this happen?" or "What is the direct cause?"** - that thing often becomes the subject in English, even if it's inanimate.
- ChatGPT took the world by storm, **in what it's safe to say** was the biggest "wow!" moment.

The structure **"in what it's safe to say"** is grammatically awkward and not standard English.
- "ChatGPT took the world by storm, **in what was** the biggest 'wow!' moment."
- Or: "ChatGPT took the world by storm, **which it's safe to say was** the biggest 'wow!' moment."

The phrase mixes two different structures:
- "in what was..." (defining a moment) = "in something that was"
- "it's safe to say..." (expressing cautious opinion)
<!--SR:!2025-10-17,3,250-->
-

[in, of, on,...] what was
?
**Why use this structure?**
         It adds emphasis and drama. Compare:
           - Simple: "This was the biggest moment in tech history."
           - Dramatic: "This happened in what was the biggest moment in tech history."

Remember that the amygdala, and the limbic system of which it’s a key part, is an ancient part of the brain—so old that primitive mammals have their own versions of this system.
?
The "of which" phrasing inverts the normal word order (we'd usually say "which it's a key part of") to avoid ending with a preposition
- natural word order would be much clearer
	- "the amygdala, and the limbic system that it's a key part of
	- the amygdala, which is a key part of the limbic system

- “Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.” We need more cartoon charactes like Iroh. If only for his character, “Avatar: The Last Airbender” is worth watching and rewatching.
- Meta and Google have been using stacking for closer to a decade:
- Lorenz’s incisive commentary on the app’s rise and fall captures the fundamental tension between social platforms and the creators they rely on.
- experiencing what they offer as a cloying simulacrum of the human experience.
- Instead, chatbots are predictive — making probabilistic guesses about which words seem right based on the massive corpus of text that their underlying large language models were trained on.
- innovation begets innovation.
- Venture funding comes at a cost, and the bill usually falls due later.
