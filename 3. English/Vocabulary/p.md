**Etymology**

~ and "**pasture**" are related. Both terms are derived from the Latin word "pastor," which means "**shepherd**." The term "~" refers to the lifestyle of shepherds or **rural** life, often idealized in literature, art, and music. It suggests a simple, idyllic way of life in the **countryside**, closely associated with **herding** and tending to livestock, typically in pastures.

On the other hand, "pasture" refers more specifically to **land** covered with grass or similar vegetation used for grazing by livestock. The connection between the two words lies in their shared reference to the activities and environments associated with **shepherding** and **rural**, **agricultural** life.

Noun: prestige


**Etymology:** comes from the Latin word "praestigiosus," which means "**full of tricks**" or "**deceitful**," derived from "praestigiae" (tricks or illusions). Interestingly, the original connotation of "prestigious" was somewhat **negative**, associated with trickery or deceit. However, by the 19th century, the meaning of "prestigious" underwent a significant transformation. It came to be associated with awe and admiration, losing its earlier negative connotations. This change reflects a broader shift in how society perceives and values appearances and reputation. Today, "prestigious" is commonly used to describe things that are highly respected and admired, particularly in fields like education, arts, and various professions.
