**In Mathematics:**
An ~ point refers to a point on a curve at which the curve changes from being concave (curved inward) to convex (curved outward), or vice versa. It's a point where the second derivative of a function changes sign. For example, on a simple curve like a sine wave, each point where the wave starts to curve in the opposite direction is an inflection point.

An ~ point signifies a key moment of change, but the specific nature of this change differs depending on the field. In mathematics, it's a change in the curvature of a graph, while in business, it's a significant shift in progress or direction.

**Synonyms:** turning point, pivotal moment, watershed, critical point, juncture.
